      <h2>The Story Beneath the Surface</h2>
      <p>
        Every mark tells a story. Every grip, a memory held tight.
        Here, the fire isn't just metaphor—it's motion, it's voice, it's presence.

      <h2>More to Come</h2>
      <p>
        This space will evolve—into galleries, layered experiences, audio-sensual loops,
        or cinematic echoes of skin and shadow.
